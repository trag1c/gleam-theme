# Gleam Theme

A VSCode color theme based on the one found on [Gleam](https://gleam.run)'s
website. 

Shoutout to [@aslilac](https://github.com/aslilac) and
[@lpil](https://github.com/lpil) for the original design! ❤️

My part of the job was implementing the original colors, adding some missing
ones and designing the rest of the editor :)
